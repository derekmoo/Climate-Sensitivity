## Introduction

- Climate change presents an urgent global challenge, with the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) providing a key measure of the Earth's susceptibility to human influence.
- Estimates of ECS have relied on multiple lines of evidence, but significant uncertainty persists regarding the likely range.
- This work explores how omitting or incorporating different lines of ECS evidence impacts probabilistic projections from a simple climate model, showing the relative significance of each for accurate future warming projections.
